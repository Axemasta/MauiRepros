# Maui Community Toolkit .NET 9 Release Crash

[![Issue Status](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/detail/state/CommunityToolkit/Maui/2494)](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui/issues/2494)

This reproduction shows a release mode startup crash when using the maui community toolkit.

I have tried to add a linker file, have hard code references and even disable AOT but nothing seems to resolve the crash.Ã¥
